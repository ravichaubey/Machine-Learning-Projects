## Methodology

1. Read Image and convert it in to a tidy format to work with.

2. Using Elbow method for `KMeasn Clustering Algorithm` **(Unsupervised Learning)** , Find optimal number of clusters of given image.

3. Recreate model with optimal number of Cluster.

4. Use Cluster center (RGB) value to show dominant color.

## Tools Used

1. Python
2. SciPy
3. Unsupervised Learning

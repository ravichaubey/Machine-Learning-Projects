`This problem is taken from Andrew NG course on coursera and implementation is done by me.`

# Problem Statement 1

Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their
results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.

# Problem Statement 2

Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. From these two tests,
you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.
